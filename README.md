Implementation of the paper "VITON-GAN: Virtual Try-on Image Generator Trained with Adversarial Loss" by Shion Honda.  
https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/egp20191043  
Preprint version is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07926).

## Installation
### Prerequisites

```
PIL
PyTorch
TorchVision
tqdm
```

In addition, you need OpenPose and Look Into Person (LIP) to get keypoints and segmentation of the human body.

### Download repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/shionhonda/viton-gan
```
### Trained model
You can get trained model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zcc55A1w6bUNG4cMYnmsIPvOJWvBsmDH?usp=sharing).
## Usage
VITON-GAN requires the keypoints from OpenPose and segmentation labels from Look Into Person.   
First, prepare the following directories in viton-gan/viton_gan/data:

- cloth
- cloth mask
- person
- person-parse
- pose

Second, prepare a file that makes pairs of clothing and human. For example, `test_pairs.txt`:

```
000001_0.jpg 001744_1.jpg
000010_0.jpg 004325_1.jpg
.
.
.
```

You can find more information here: https://github.com/sergeywong/cp-vton

After preparing the data and the list, run the following command:

```
$ python train_gmm.py
$ python run_gmm.py # warp clothing so that it fit on the body
$ python train_tom.py
$ python run_gmm.py # generate virtual try-on image
```
